# ReportCard-Java-Class
My custom Report Card class.

A custom class for report cards. This class contains 2 attributes. An attribute for the Student, represented by a custom student class object, declared as an inner class below, and then an ArrayList of custom Grade class objects, again declared as an inner class below. I have also written custom inner classes for Modules and Teachers, with methods contained within.

I initially wrote all the custom classes separately before realising I was only allowed submit it in one class file. I then came up with this solution. Ideally the classes would be separated out and the ReportCard constructor below would initialise both its attributes that would be passed as parameters.
